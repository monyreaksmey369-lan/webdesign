    <h1>Introduction to HTML!</h1>
    <p>Hello allðŸ‘‹.My name is reak smey. I hope you are doing well. 
     As you have read the title you might know what is going to be in this blog but wait, 
    <p>maybe you don't know it or you might find something which you had no idea. 
     So give this short article a quick read.</p>
    <h2>Story behind writing this blog</h2>
    <p>A few years ago, when I was asked about react, my answer was that itâ€™s just js. Yes, it is js
     but what next what it does do? Why is everyone around </p>
    <p>talking about it? I was looking for a very elementary article or read about React. But I didn't find anything.
     And even now I see many of my colleagues </p>
    <p>or my friends going through the same,so I have decided to write articles on React which help them to initiate their react journey.</p>
    <p>I'll try my level best to make these articles very easy as I have done with my java or CSS articles.</p>
    <p>So in this article, I'll try to give you guys an overview of what actually React is, won't take you to the coding part or tough technical terms will keep</p>
    <p>simple and complete it in a few points.
    Please add something from your side in the comment section.</p>

    <h2>Concluding</h2>
    <p>React has completely changed the way we build modern web applications. Its component-based structure, fast performance,</p> 
    <p>single-page application approach make it one of the most powerful tools for front-end developers. Whether youâ€™re</p>
    <p>just starting your React journey or looking to strengthen your basics, understanding how React manages the user interface</p>
    <p>is the first step toward mastering it.</p>
